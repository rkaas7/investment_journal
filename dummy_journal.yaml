    title: "Rebalancing Plan for Q2"
    note: >
      I'm planning to rebalance my portfolio in early June. Will reduce exposure to tech by 10% and increase defensive positions (healthcare, utilities). The goal is to stabilize returns as volatility increases.

    title: "Don’t Chase Earnings Hype"
    note: >
      I bought into a small-cap stock right before earnings, based purely on Reddit hype. The company missed estimates and the stock dropped 18% overnight. Lesson: don’t chase speculative moves without a clear thesis.
